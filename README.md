# ðŸ”Ž Optifine Checker

Some modpacks require optifine in order to work correctly. This mod adds a simple screen telling the user to install optifine, if it cannot be detected.

**Important!** This mod is clientside only, it **cannot** detect if a player logs into on a server using optifine!

### Features
- Shows a Startup Screen if optifine isn't installed
- You can choose between different modes: REMIND and FORCE
- It's possible to change what class should be searched for (in case optifine changes it structure)
